# Face_Mask_Detection
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.


## Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python

We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.
